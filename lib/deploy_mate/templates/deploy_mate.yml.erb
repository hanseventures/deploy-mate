  # Which GIT branch should be deployed to the defined server by default?

  #
  #   bundle exec cap prestage deploy branch=feature/xyz

  # Which is the ssh shortcut to connect to the server. It should be configured
  # in your ~/.ssh/config. You should be able to connect to the server using:
  #
  #   ssh specified_ssh_name
  #
  ssh_name: prestage-server

  # Since you are able to connect to the server with the specified ssh shortcurt,
  # usually more persons should be able to access it. You can specify a list of
  # public ssh keys which will be copied to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the
  # server. If the list is empty, the current key setting will be left untouched on
  # the server.
